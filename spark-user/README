Building the docker image
==========================

IMPORTANT:

Before building this Docker image, you'll need to run the following (in the
directory where the Dockerfile is located):

        wget https://www-us.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.4.4/spark-2.4.4-bin-without-hadoop.tgz
        wget https://www-us.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.10.0/hadoop-2.10.0.tar.gz

wget + https + docker don't play nicely together, so it ended up being easier
to just get docker to copy the .tgz files into the image directly.



Running a container
===================

The user will need to update their assigned S3 access key and secret within
/root/spark-2.4.4/conf/spark-defaults.conf before trying to use spark
to access any Swift data files.
